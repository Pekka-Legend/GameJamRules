    <h1>LEBO Game Jam Rules</h1>
    <h3><b>The LEBO Game Jam is a friendly </b>competition where games are 
        submitted and voted on by peers. To submit a game, it must
        be emailed to me @ccampanaro04@mtlstudents.net so that I
        can put it on the Game Jam's website. For now, the only
        games that I know how to host are Scratch games and
        JavaScript / HTML Canvas games. If you are a beginner I recommend going
        with Scratch as you need to make a website of your own for
        JavaScript (otherwise it will show that I made it). The Jam 
        will take place for 1 week and will be advertised on the
        anouncements for a few days before. The voting will be held for 2 days
        after the Jam ends. Late submissions are accepted during the voting
        but may result in less votes.
